This project is part 1 in our exploration of API usage. It uses the youtube API and ajax functionality to retrieve videos and display them on the DOM.
There are two HTML files: one index and one template.
The template file is added to the DOM using a .get function after the page is ready. 
The js file contains the API call and jquery push to the DOM
The stylesheet is in addtion to a bootstrap library that is in the project folder.

##Longterm goals for this project:##
GET and append multiple videos at a time.
  
GET playlists that user can stream on a seperate page. 

A search button where users can search for videos they like - this would add additional query words to the current one, redefining the search pattern. 

Functionality to livestream video events on the DOM. 

####All of these attributes are possible using the google youtubes API.####
